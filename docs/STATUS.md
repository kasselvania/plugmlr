# Original application: observation and first source trace

Recorded 2026-09-09. The baseline is repository main at
`5f4b801fea36a33599b2a6bb8b2e34eaeeb527a6`, verified against the remote before
creating `codex/original-playback-observations`. This update changes documentation
only. The current job is to understand and harden the existing musical path in
small steps; the broad R1 implementation plan has been set aside.

## Preserved work and source map

The rejected rewrite is preserved on `codex/r1-shared-buffer-playback` at
`fb808b13c12bb818a7c59798c630be172ec08631` and in
[PR #1](https://github.com/kasselvania/plugmlr/pull/1). Its uncommitted changes,
untracked files, and ignored renders were saved with `git stash --all` as
`23dfe32e8cfd76a15ecc0f4c8a30248dd95704a0` (message begins
`Failed experiment: R1 rewrite before archival`). Do not apply or drop this stash
as part of the original application's investigation. Those experiments are not
acceptance evidence for this baseline.

| Source | Role in the original entry path |
| --- | --- |
| [mlr.pd](../mlr.pd) | Application controls, clock/Grid paths, `arrays-samples`, and mixer. Instantiates sample data, live buffer, and player for IDs 1–16. |
| [sample-data.pd](../sample-data.pd) | File chooser, two sample arrays, `soundfiler`, sample metadata publication. |
| [live_buffer.pd](../live_buffer.pd) | Live arrays, size/index metadata, recording-related messages. Recording not tested here. |
| [sample_player_rebuild.pd](../sample_player_rebuild.pd) | Selected buffer, transport, loop/slice logic, rate glide, playbar, two stereo readers, and gain transitions. |
| [mixer.pd](../mixer.pd) | Track output gain/envelope. Track 1 is implemented inline in `mlr.pd`; tracks 2–16 use this abstraction. |

Alternative players remain useful references, not automatically active code.
For example, `sampler_playback.pd` contains a post-load refresh receiver absent
from the active player. The installed copy at
`/Users/peterkassel/Documents/plugdata/Patches/Kasselvania/mlr-lite` also differs
from this checkout, including its player logic. It is a read-only reference;
the observed application was opened from this repository.

## What was observed

Runtime: `/Applications/plugdata.app`, **0.9.4 nightly `98ae0f78b`**, Pd **0.56.3**,
Pd-Lua **0.12.23**, on macOS **26.4.1 (25E253), arm64**. This was a native plugdata
session. Audio-device settings were not freshly recorded as part of this baseline.

- `mlr.pd` opened, along with its saved `arrays-samples` and `grid-input-output`
  views. The 1–16 buffer/player objects were visible; the console printed reader
  setup messages for them. With ordinary messages hidden and errors shown, the
  startup error view was empty. Ordinary messages were then restored.
- The existing Sample 1 load control opened the native chooser and loaded the
  repository's `DrumLoop.wav`. During this observation the control was triggered
  using plugdata's console selection and `bang` after pointer attempts were
  inconclusive; it was the existing `1-sample-load` control, not a helper loader.
- Both arrays in `sample-data 1` visibly populated. Its UI showed **631881 frames**,
  **44100 Hz**, and **39492.6** frames per slice (rounded display). Read-only
  `afinfo` agreed: stereo, 24-bit PCM, 44100 Hz, 631881 frames, 14.328367 seconds.
- Player 1 selected `sample_buffer`, `1`. Pressing its Play/Pause button moved the
  playbar. After the user raised the mixer, the user confirmed audible output.
  This establishes **Sample 1 → player/channel 1 → mixer → output**.

User listening report, recorded separately from source/console evidence:

> “it cuts out part way through the loop that plays, then, goes through a full
> loop without audio. then, starts again.”

The playbar continued moving. Representative console messages included
`dsp-message: dsp_off 0`, `voice_1_vline: 631881`, `dsp-message: dsp_on 1`, and
`voice_1_vline: 631865`. These are existing debug prints, not explicit runtime
errors or proof of a cause. The relationship to reader switching, gain fades,
loop bounds, and beat resets has not yet been established.

There is working playback infrastructure and a reproducible musical fault.
No explicit console error was observed in the inspected startup view; that does
not prove every path works or establish the cause of the audible fault. Other
channels, reverse, glide, slice triggering, quantization/beat reset, physical Grid
feedback, recording, and buffer replacement have not been individually validated.
Connected controls and code for several of these already exist.

Evidence here is the session's direct UI/console inspection, the user's listening
report, and the file metadata check. No rendered audio, numerical audio checks,
standalone console export, or new test harness was retained for this baseline.
No Pd patch was edited or saved during the observation.

## First chunk: loader to player metadata

This is a trace of the actual objects and `#X connect` edges, not a proposed new
interface. Line references below refer to the baseline commit above.

1. In `sample-data.pd` (lines 10–25), `$1-sample-load` triggers `openpanel`.
   `t a b b` fills two table symbols before sending the path through `pack s s s`
   and `prepend read -resize` to `soundfiler`. The resulting order is
   `read -resize PATH 1-sample_buffer_ID 0-sample_buffer_ID`: file channel 1 enters
   prefix `1`, file channel 2 enters prefix `0`.
2. The frame-count outlet supplies the end field and `N / 16` slice length.
   First index is set to zero; a literal `1` supplies the loaded flag. The rate
   metadata is divided by 1000, yielding samples per millisecond. The packet on
   `s_b_buffer_states` is `ID loaded_flag rate_kHz slice_frames first_index end`.
   For the observed file the graph yields `1 1 44.1 39492.5625 0 631881`; this
   exact packet was not captured as a console print. The field named “last index”
   carries frame count `N`, not `N - 1`.
3. In the player's `buffer_&_loop` (lines 175–208), `route` matches the selected
   buffer number. `t a b` sends `$0-loaded_sample` **before** unpacking the new
   metadata. `buffer_selection_setup_and_logic` uses that bang to select this
   player's own sample-buffer number through the existing GUI/message path.
4. Selection sends `$0-send_target`. The player sends the target's `_select_bang`
   and `_load_up` messages and refreshes cached indexes with `$0-update_indexes`.
   Only afterward does the pending sample packet finish unpacking. Its loaded
   flag is sent to `$0-loaded_update_indexes` after the other fields are stored,
   but the active player has **no receiver for that completion message**.
   The initial Play path separately sends `$0-update_indexes` (line 363).

This ordering is consistent with the observed console sequence: after loading,
`1188-loop_end` still printed `48000`; pressing Play printed `631881` and loop
start `0`. It identifies a metadata handoff problem to isolate. It does **not**
establish the cause of the subsequent alternating silent passes.

Three local candidates from this trace, with no implementation changes yet:

| Candidate | Existing evidence and narrow next check |
| --- | --- |
| Complete the post-load refresh after metadata is stored. | The active player emits an unreceived completion message. `sampler_playback.pd`, lines 1239–1242, already has `r $0-loaded_update_indexes → sel 1 → s $0-update_indexes`. Evaluate that small existing pattern against the selection order, then inspect load-time bounds before pressing Play. |
| Resolve the channel-order discrepancy. | The loader orders arrays `1, 0`; `tabread_processing` constructs reader targets `0, 1` (lines 708–730). The console printed `set 0-sample_buffer_1 1-sample_buffer_1`. Verify the complete output with distinct left-only/right-only material before changing ordering; ordinary stereo listening did not establish it. |
| Validate successful load publication. | `sample-data.pd` publishes a literal loaded flag without a positive-frame-count check; channel metadata is unused. Missing/empty/mono-file behavior has not been exercised. Check what the actual loader emits in those cases before adding a small guard. |

The next buffer trace must account for two existing details: sample and live
metadata packets have different layouts (`l_b_buffer_states` is
`ID rate_kHz first_index end slice_frames content_flag`), and `sample-data.pd`
has no `_select_bang` or `_load_up` receiver to republish metadata on reselection.
The loader also resizes its arrays directly. Selection, alignment, swapping, and
replacement behavior therefore need observation before refactoring.

## Continue in the existing musical order

Finish the loader/metadata handoff, then follow buffer selection and adjustment
into transport, loop bounds, and play state. Follow those messages into the two
internal readers and their gain/crossover logic, and then verify the connected
slice, glide, direction, and visual-feedback paths. Keep the actual patch and
console visible when reproducing each behavior; record a cause only once the
source trace and observation support it.

The two readers used for transitions are parts of one musical player. Understand
and stabilize that player before discussing additional independently controlled
players. No head-count expansion or new engine framework is part of this update.
